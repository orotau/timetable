Thoughts as at Tuesday 17 April 2018

The application is functional although it relies on manually ....

a) Creating the week structure and copying it into other weeks in the thunderbird calendar app, then exporting and importing into google calendar
b) Creating the "all day events" for days (not absolutely necessary for it to function but it looks better)
c) Deleting the events in the days that are holidays (not absolutely necessary for it to function but it looks better)

To use activate the virtual environment "waitakere_calendar".

This is what pip freeze looks like
google-api-python-client==1.6.6
httplib2==0.11.3
iso8601==0.1.12
numpy==1.14.2
oauth2client==4.1.2
pyasn1==0.4.2
pyasn1-modules==0.2.1
python-dateutil==2.7.2
rsa==3.4.2
six==1.11.0
uritemplate==3.0.0

I have coloured the lines to the end of the year, steps b and c required for terms 3 and 4 of 2018

To improve...
- Automate the steps b and c
- Automate a
- Create tests
- Allow querying of 'description' data to get summary of plan for lesson and outcome
