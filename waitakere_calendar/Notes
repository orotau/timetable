How to run

Start the virtual environment waitakere_calendar
Go to the folder ~/PythonProjects/waitakere_calendar/waitakere_calendar$ 
This will create the calendar for term 3 "python calendar.py create_term_calendar 3" (no inverted commas)

You DON'T need to worry about any overwriting because a brand new calendar is created with a timestamp
added to the end of the name.

This will work for the year 2018 (terms 1 through to 4)

For 2019 a few things will need to change

Create y2019.py with the appropriate data
Change all references to 2018 in waitakere.py to 2019, that should do it

Just before I moved on to the next project I altered the name of waitakere.py to calendar.py
and it stopped working - don't know why

I tried a couple of solutions, but failed, a bit lost but this is making me think I should keep
the calendar function and the planning separate!

This is the post that led to me chaning line 2 in waitakere.py

I will just stick with that as it doesn't seem to have done any harm
