How to run

Start the virtual environment waitakere_calendar
Go to the folder ~/PythonProjects/waitakere_calendar/waitakere_calendar$ 
This will create the calendar for term 3 "python waitakere.py create_term_calendar 3" (no inverted commas)

You DON'T need to worry about any overwriting because a brand new calendar is created with a timestamp
added to the end of the name.

This will work for the year 2018 (terms 1 through to 4)

For 2019 a few things will need to change

Create y2019.py with the appropriate data
Change all references to 2018 in waitakere.py to 2019, that should do it
